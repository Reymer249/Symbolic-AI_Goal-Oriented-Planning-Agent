# Symbolic AI ‚Äì Goal-Oriented Planning Agent

This project implements a **goal-oriented BDI agent** (Beliefs, Desires, Intentions) in **Java**. The agent must escape a maze by reasoning about the environment using a custom simplified first-order logic language (sfol) and applying planning and inference techniques.

It was developed as part of the course **Symbolic AI (4032KI), Leiden University, Assignment 3**.

## üß† Project Overview

The agent is designed to:

- **Perceive** the environment (maze layout, walls, keys, doors, exit).

- **Think** using a knowledge base encoded in **sfol**.

- **Decide** actions based on planning (iterative deepening search).

- **Act** by executing environment actions until it escapes the maze.

The project integrates **predicate logic, forward chaining inference, and planning** to build a symbolic reasoning system capable of solving a navigation task.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- **Custom logic language (sfol):**

  - Predicates, terms, and rules similar to Prolog.

  - Support for operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `_`) for belief/goal/action manipulation.

  - Reserved predicates: `=`, `!=`, and `!` for negation.

- **BDI architecture:**

  - **Beliefs:** facts about the world (e.g., location, passages, keys).

  - **Desires:** goals the agent adopts (e.g., obtain a key, reach the exit).

  - **Intentions:** selected plans of action.

- **Planning with iterative deepening:**

  - Combines **depth-first search** with iterative deepening up to depth 7.

  - Generates plans (sequences of actions) to achieve goals.

- **Agent cycle:**

  1. Sense ‚Üí process percepts into beliefs.

  2. Think ‚Üí infer rules and adopt goals.

  3. Decide ‚Üí generate plans using planning algorithm.

  4. Act ‚Üí execute actions in the maze.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Requirements

Java JDK 11 or higher

Eclipse IDE (or any Java IDE)

### Running the Agent

By default, the agent automatically makes decisions based on its BDI logic.

To manually select actions, set `Agent.HUMAN_DECISION` = true in `Agent.java`.

To debug belief updates, set `Agent.DEBUG = true` to print detailed knowledge base changes.
